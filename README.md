# hedgehog-track-system

We have an exciting new project that we need your help with. We have been microchipping our released hedgehogs since the middle of last year so we can monitor which hedgehogs return to the rescue and monitor their success in the wild. 

As part of the process we have been working on the plans for a hedgehog feeding station that scans the microchip and notifies us of the visit via a radio receiver installed by Leeds City Council. The intention is to install a network of these around Otley (and other areas) to see where our prickly friends end up and how far they are travelling. The information collected will hopefully be used in research to establish how dependent our urban hedgehogs are on support feeding by the community and the distances they travel. 

We need a small but committed team of volunteers who can assist with our project to develop the electronics and software to both control the unit and display the information via our website. The unit will likely be comprised of an Arduino microprocessor, LoRaWan transmitter, solar charging and 
RFID reader.

If you have the suitable skill set to assist I would love to hear from you
